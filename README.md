# About me

## Why data analytics?
I was browsing through a well known Video-Platform when I stumbled accross a Video from *David Kriesel*.  </p>
[SpiegelMining - Reverse Engineering von Spiegel-Online (33c3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YpwsdRKt8Q)  </p>
First of all the visualizations are absolutely fascinating and I would consider myself a "visual"[^1] type of person,  </br> for that reason this caught my eye immediately.  <br>
Secondly the assumptions he made based off his data were as comprehensible as they were surprising.  <br>
The "knowledge" you can gain access through data was beyond my imagination.  </p>
I strongly recommend you watching the video because it will almost certainly blow your mind :exploding_head:.

## How I started programming?
Just like many others I did not know where to start.  </p>
So I decided to use my internet addiction to my advantage and do more research until I found the channel of *Niklas Steenfatt*.  <br>
He had a recommendation for me i wouldn´t regret.  <br>
MasterSchools.  <br>
I started my journey in 2023 and just recently graduaded from MasterSchool as Data Analyst.  <br>


#### What I learned at Masterschool
We starded off with some basics like getting used to the chain of command that is necessary for a lot of programming languages.  <br>
Generally speaking we learned how to draw conclusions and identify trends using statistical methods and how to visualize them.  <br>
I can´t list all of the contents of the course but here is a quick overview over the general tools we used:  
  - Python
  - SQL
  - Excel (and Google Sheets)
  - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roland.pund/viz/GloBox_Project_1/KPIOverview)

## Time before data
I originally learned as a *Mechantronic* and worked as such for almost a decade.  <br>
Besides working as a Mechatronic I felt the need to further educate to become a *State certified mechanical Engineer* with the focus on construction.  <br>
While doing all of that I somehow fell in "love" with numbers :heart:.

## What´s next?
- [x] graduating at *MasterSchool*
- [ ] finding a job in tec
- [ ] studying *Mathematics* (B.Sc.)
- [ ] studying *DataScience* (M.Sc.)
- [ ] ...

[^1]: When working with e.g. broken rational functions or doing vector calculations I always want to know exactly what I´m doing. So I´m a big fan of "visual"- learning/exploring.
